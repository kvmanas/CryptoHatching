There are mainly 3 parts

**User**
User can interact with game , buy gaminig units ,attack enimies.It is used to upload the details of user.In this client , the transcations are done using a user own private key. Here it is not hardcoded with the client .The User part allows the user/gamer to interact with the system by performing actions such as buying battle products or units such as Battle-birds, eggs and pigs. These units are used in such a way that the battle takesplace in an manner depending upon the values of theese products or units

**Admin**
Here transcations are done using a private key. the key is generated by using “ sawtooth keygen admin ”. The Admin is used to add/edit gaming uints

**Trusted Oracle**
Trusted Oracle used to securley verify timestamp when user attack enimies or buy new units

**Addressing Scheme**

Production Unit address= hash("AdminTP").slice(0,8)+"0011"+hash(unique ID of gaming unit).slice(0,58)

Attacking Unit address= hash("AdminTP").slice(0,8)+"0022"+hash(unique ID of gaming unit).slice(0,58)

Users data address= hash("OracleTP").slice(0,8)+"0011"+hash(user Public key).slice(0,58)

Hashing is done using SHA512.

**State Address Storaging Scheme**

Production /Attacking Unit address= ["Unique ID","Unite Name"," Unit Price","Unit Base production Rate","unit upgrade details in object"]

Users data address= {User Production rate,User Attack Power,User Defence Power,User Egg (Production Unit)balance,User Last Activity in Timestamp,User Prodution Unit Detail,User Attacking Unit Detail,User Public Key,User Last attacked time in timestamp,User total numer of attacks,User Attack Logs}
